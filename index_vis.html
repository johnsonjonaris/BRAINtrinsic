<h2>Connectome</h2>
This tool allows to visualize the Connectome that describes how the regions of the brain are interconnected.
Particularly, the tools enable to perform the exploration of the intrinsic geometry of the brain, by letting the user
switch quickly different topological spaces where the connectome is embedded.
With a simple and easy-to-use interface, users can explore all the connections with a edge-on-demand technique and focus on
very specific area by switching on and off regions of the brain. Simple analytics such as nodal strength and shortest path
trees can be computed on the fly. This tool has been developed with virtual reality in mind and it is compatible with
Head Mounted Displays such as Oculus Rift (both DK1 and DK2).

<h3>Acknoledgement</h3>
The tool was entirely developed the <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/creativecoding/">Creative Coding Research Group</a>, directed by Prof.
Angus Forbes. The research group is part of the <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu">Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL)</a>  at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).
This research is being done in collaboration with Alex Leow, Olusola Ajilore, and Allen Ye, all belonging to UIC Department of Psychiatry.
